        <p>Ornela Hunda is ready to take coding to the next level. From her balanced academic coursework in Computer Science
          and Economics at the University of Tirana, to product experience in R&D, she strives to make a lasting impact.
          Sheâ€™s a natural born leader whose innovative mindset and affinity for problem solving has brought tremendous success
          to team projects. She has been involved in extracurricular activities and rigorous case studies, which have enhanced
          her unique skillset in coding, web development, and website design. She has even developed abilities in 3-D modeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a foundation in algorithms and data structures, she started her journey at a very young age, picking up pseudocode with
          ease. Next came computer architecture, computer networking, cryptography, programming languages, emphasizing C++,
          and Java and recently web development and web designing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ornela has dreamed working surrounded by equally inquisitive minds where she can continue to flourish. She seeks to utilize
          her efficient and creative problem solving skills and employ her ability to prioritize and manage competing demands
          to positive ends.
